3. Monetization Architecture: Keep It Modular
	1.	Core Persona SaaS (B2B)
	•	$___ per active student for data vault + API access (schools, districts, edtechs).
	•	Value prop: shrink admin workload, boost aid yield, improve retention.
	2.	Marketplace Revenue Share (B2C)
	•	10–20 % of any aid recovered, internship placed, or book sold.
	•	Stripe Connect for flow-through payments so you don’t handle scholarship funds directly.
	3.	Premium Feature Bundles
	•	Scholarship Scout Pro (unlimited essay polishing, ACT Coach) – $99/yr.
	•	University Launch Pack (moving checklist, textbook savings, roommate match) – $49 one-time.
	4.	API Licensing to Vertical Partners
	•	Offer “Persona-as-a-Service” so third-party XR tour builders, study-abroad firms, or fintech apps can query verified student data with OAuth-like scopes.
	5.	White-Label Agent SDK
	•	Sell a toolkit to guidance-counseling software vendors that lets them spin up agents atop your persona schema, paying per 1K API calls.

4. Decision Filters Before You Spin a New Agent
	1.	Adjacency – Does it reuse 70 %+ of the pipelines you’ve built (crawl, vector, draft)?
	2.	Clear Payer – Can you name who writes the check and why within one sentence?
	3.	Low Trust Barrier – Scholarships & FAFSA require high trust; test-prep or coupon-finding can launch faster.
	4.	Data Flywheel – Will the new use case feed more context back into the persona, strengthening all agents?
	5.	Compliance Load – FAFSA or health data adds regulation; internships and textbook deals are lighter.

Immediate Action Steps
	1.	Pick two fast-adjacent micro-agents (e.g., EssayPolish + ACT Boost Coach) and prototype as toggle features by re-using your retrieval-generation loop.
	2.	Draft the Persona Schema v0.2 with fields covering academics, finance, wellness, and preferences—future proof for XR.
	3.	Define the API contract so external builders (or future you) can pull persona slices with scoped tokens.
	4.	Pilot a B2B call with one local high school counseling office: show Hawkeye + EssayPolish upsell path and price per senior.
	5.	Sketch an XR proof-of-concept (Unity or WebXR) where Chloe’s avatar walks the OU campus, answers major-specific questions—use it as pitch fodder for universities.

Execute, measure revenue per seat, and double down where CAC ≪ LTV. With the persona in place, every new agent is a thin service layer riding the same data rail—you’re effectively building the operating system for a student’s early-adult life.
